On 12 May, we have covered these topics:
- Introduction to Flutter
- Flutter and Firebase setup
- Registration Form UI and Logic
- Firebase CRUD

Notes: https://blushing-zebu-c9c.notion.site/Basic-Flutter-Development-26856b4bdedd4c1db3ec0a178142b5d0

Firebase CLI: https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios

We have done a registration form during the tutorial. I have added more elements based on the previous session, such as Radio Button, Multiline Text, and many other TextFormField parameters.

Notice how customizable Flutter is in terms of designing the Form UI.

You could setup the Firebase on your own and see how the data is added into the Firestore.

Another thing that I did was code refactoring. We can reuse the TextFormField widget as many as we like and customize according to the desired parameters. As a result, the code is much cleaner and easier to maintain.
